summary: "A rudimentary storage system that manages an inventory of computers."
---

In this Java project, I built a class to manage computer objects, an exception class for error handling, and a user-friendly driver program with a menu for efficient storage. I handled the entire project, from implementing the professor's guidelines to completing all aspects of the development.

This project significantly contributed to my understanding of class and driver design. It also played a key role in improving my skills in exception handling and working with Linked Lists. Additionally, working with Linked Lists provided me with valuable insights into data structure management and manipulation. Overall, this hands-on project enriched my Java programming skills, offering a comprehensive exploration of class structures, exception handling, and data structures like Linked Lists."
