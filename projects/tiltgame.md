summary: "A simple game where you control a ball on the screen using tilt controls on SenseHAT."
---

The project aimed to use the Sense HAT IMU sensor attached to a Raspberry PI to collect data and turn it into a Tilt Ball Game. The game allows the user to control a dot on the led matrix, that is controlled by tilting the device. Over a two-week period, the project was approached with the primary goals of implementing a point system, and refining the character's movement to provide a controlled and responsive feel. 

I played a solo role in both coding and testing, handling every aspect of the project independently.

This project marked my first dive into Python, learning the basics like syntax and data types. I also figured out how to use a sensor to control the in-game character. The movement being the focus of the program had different aspects to it, such as bouncing off of walls, acceleration, and smoothness of motion.
