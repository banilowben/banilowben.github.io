## First things first

As a first time user of Stack Overflow, I am mostly unaware of the normal proceedings and culture that is the norm for the website. (not counting googling a problem and having the top result be the exact issue answered on Stack Overflow) I also have never participated in a forum before, so this whole thing is unfamiliar to me. I am now tasked with understanding what is an acceptable or ‘smart’  question and what is a ‘not smart’ question (or a loser question). Lucky for me there is a guide by Eric Steven Raymond called “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way.”

After indulging in all 10,870 words I am left baffled by the tone of what I just read. This guy comes in hot with a disclaimer that he is NOT responsible for solving the world's technical problems… ok… then he gives us a peek into the demeanor of a real hacker, and what constitutes a loser (or luser). While I agree with the author that people who don’t attempt to try to solve a problem and just expect a free answer from a ‘hacker’ is annoying and a waste of time, the way it comes across is pretty funny.
