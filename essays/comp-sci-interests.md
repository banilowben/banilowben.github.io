## The spark

My first exposure to programming was in the summer when I was 9 years old. My parents had just gotten a new computer with Windows 7, and I managed to convince them to let me have the old Dell Dimension in my room. I, of course, planned to play runescape and adventure quest, but my dad had other plans. He bought a book about programming in Ruby and almost every night that summer we would work on a section in that book. It was very simple stuff like making programs that would respond to specific phrases, and other stuff nine year olds are able to do with help from their parents, but I remember being amazed at how the computer could do so many things with so little input. This brief exposure to programming shaped the way I perceived computers and would ultimately lead to where I am today.

## Why computer science

I wouldn’t describe myself as a hardline computer scientist, as I enjoy all physical sciences and I like to dabble, but there are aspects of computer science that I think are really interesting and beneficial. First being that the start up cost of learning and creating a program is just a computer. (Doesn’t even need to be a good one) The idea of being able to just sit down and start punching away at a keyboard to create something  is surreal. Another being, most other disciplines require extensive machinery or setups that limit the ability to experiment. Theory is interesting, but for me, having tangible applicable results is when I have the most fun.

## My future

I wouldn’t say that I have a specific program or application that I am dying to build, but there have definitely been times in my life where I wished I could make something either for fun/curiosity or to gain an advantage in a video game. One instance of this would be when I wanted to make a mod for Minecraft after playing the aether mod. Being a young kid at the time I stood very little chance at making a mod that would reflect what I was probably imagining in my head. Nonetheless I tried and failed, never being able to bring to life what definitely would have been the best super power mod minecraft had ever seen. Seriously though, these kinds of ideas occur all the time when I am enjoying something, but something could be slightly better. Often it could be a preference but being able to customize an experience (and more and more of life is experienced on the computer) is a big component of my interest in computer science. Ultimately my goal is to develop a foundation in computer science that allows me to approach any problem or project I encounter.
