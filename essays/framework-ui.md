## Background
<p>I enjoy learning new things, so I would say I enjoyed learning about web development in the last two weeks. However, with the time constraints imposed by a class schedule along with other course workloads it was an unpleasant experience at times. For some background, I had never touched html or css before last week, so I am still wet behind the ears when it comes to the operations of basic website design. Unless you count the amazing text styling done at the Grand Exchange with flash2. Given that, it is amazing what can be accomplished with just surface level knowledge of html, css, and Bootstrap. I was able to closely recreate the visuals and some functionality of what I would consider modern websites.</p>

## Pros of Bootstrap
<p>Bootstrap 5 is a large framework with a boat load of features and a large community behind it. Thanks to that you can implement Bootstrap into almost any aspect of a website without the need for building huge classes to have the basic functionalities you want. The large community also contributes to finding any possible bugs or errors in the library, and to keeping the features up to date. One thing I noticed personally was how easy it was to further customize the elements that used Bootstrap with a little more css.</p>
<p>From a software engineering standpoint using a framework has a lot of advantages. Immediately it will uniformize the classes being used allowing anyone familiar with the framework to understand how the code is being implemented. It will also increase the efficiency of implementing ideas since you won’t be rewriting code for every project. The lack of rewriting code also prevents accidental errors from occurring. Finally, and maybe most importantly, Bootstrap has great cross-platform compatibility.</p>

## Cons of Bootstrap
<p>Bootstrap isn’t without its drawbacks, for one it is a mountain of information to digest. I am consistently finding classes I should’ve been using, and running into times where I am trying to implement a class I had used before and it just doesn’t work at all. This really had me going when it seemed like justify-content-center/end just worked whenever it felt like it. When I was first learning the framework I was constantly googling what each class did as I came across it, which felt very tedious at times. But overall, I wouldn’t have been able to create dynamic and well-designed websites, at least as fast, without Bootstrap.</p>
