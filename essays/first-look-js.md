## Background
I am relatively new to programming, with my first experience programming being in Fall of 2022 as a new ICS student taking the first course for the major. I was first introduced to Java, and then eventually C and C++. My programming experience has been strictly academic, meaning that I have not created a program for use outside of school. Please keep that in mind as I reflect on my initial perceptions of JavaScript, and workouts of the day as described in ICS 314 at UH Manoa.

## JavaScript
As a beginner in JavaScript, I am immediately put off by lackadaisical syntax of the functions and data types. The previous languages I have used (Java, C, C++) have all had clear data types that were written before the name of the variable. This just does not happen in JavaScript. So far I have been exposed to var, let, and const, of which var seems ultimately useless. The lack of rigidity would actually be preferred for testing ideas for programs, where you just want to know if it’ll work. However, in larger programs, I can see the lack of explicit data types being confusing to read and a one way ticket to exception city. 
	Other than the data type declaration changes, there seems to be essentially no difference in writing basic code in JavaScript vs Java. If that statement hurts you to read, just keep in mind that so far all we have done is the intro from freeCodeCamp.com and 2 introductory programming problems. (Adding together multiples of a certain number in a range, and determining if a string has more than one of the same char) The code written to solve these problems could be copied into a Java method with minimal syntax changes to make it work. I am told that there are deeper elements of the programming languages that are very different from each other, but I have not experienced those personally yet. 

## Workout of the Day
WOD, or Workout of the Day, is an exercise where there is a programming problem you need to solve within a given amount of time. The initial description of this activity sounds daunting, but after experiencing a couple practice WOD’s for myself, my current opinion on them is positive. The time constraint puts you into a mindset of doing anything to get the program to work. For me, this highlighted aspects of my code that I can make simpler and more concise. I also really like comparing approaches to the same problem with other students, as it helps me in being exposed to different aspects of programming. For example, in the string with duplicate char’s WOD, my initial thoughts went to looping through the string comparing one char to the rest of the chars. This approach worked, however, when comparing approaches with other students I saw a very nice implementation of regular expression to solve the same problem but better. I had never even heard of regex before seeing this solution, but now I can use this technique in string check cases for future programming projects. So far, the WOD's have been fun little challenges to test my programming acumen.
